# SnFoil::Controller

![build](https://github.com/limited-effort/snfoil-controller/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg) [![maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/6a7a2f643707c17cb879/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/limited-effort/snfoil-controller/maintainability)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snfoil-controller'
```

## Usage
While contexts are powerful, they aren't a magic bullet.  Each function should strive to only contain a single purpose.  This also has the added benefit of outlining some basic tests - if it is in a function it should have a related test.


### Quickstart Example

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
